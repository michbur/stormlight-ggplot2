.Te aleTi font
.kreated by turos of tempered steel

To install: place the AlethiTS.tff file in the Computer>Windows>Fonts folder.

Special charaters:
For t, use lower case t.
For th, use capital T.
For s, use lower case s.
For sh, use capital S.
For ch, use c.
X will print a combination of k and s.
For q and w, use your imagination. Technically speaking, q is a combination of k and u. W is basically a combination of a long u ("oo") and any other vowel: a e i o and short u ("uh"). Don't worry about the difference between long and short vowels when using this font, as long and short vowels use the same character.

In the Alethi alphabet, sentences start with a period '.' and don't end with anything.

There are two fonts included. AlethiTS.ttf uses spaces without a center line. AlethiTS_lined.ttf uses spaces with the center line. The difference is up to preference.

Also, added a centerline to the '.' character.
